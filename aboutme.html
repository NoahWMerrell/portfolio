        <p>I am very close to my family despite us currently living in different states from one another. As the youngest of four, I've had the unique perspective of being able to learn from their example and receive a plethora of helpful advice for the future. My sister and two brothers are all married and I've been able to learn from my in-laws as well. My family has played a major role in defining who I am today and my loving parents have taught my valuable life lessons that has enabled me to flourish and grow.</p>

I enjoy playing a myriad of board games and video games, as well as designing my own. I also am passionate about creative writing and developing my own unique ideas and settings.</p>
        <h2>What is your educational background?</h2>

After serving a 2 year mission I've been attending Brigham Young University - Idaho as a Computer Science major.</p>
